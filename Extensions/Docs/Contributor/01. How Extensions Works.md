### Why do we need extensions?

The `Hotspot Maker` is basically a program to start and stop hosted networks on a `Windows` environment. In extensions, we aim to give the users a much better experience beyond making hotspots.

I mean, there's no in-built `file sharing` system in the `Windows` environment. I know it has. But, sometimes it's hard to config. So, as an example, you can make a `file sharing` system. Why do you need to embed with `Hotspot Maker`? You know, the hotspot is used to transmit data. So, it will be a great deal!

### The extensions, how it works?

You can get a basic idea about how the extensions work. Let's dive into it.

First of all, you know we have our `GitHub` repo (`HotspotMaker`). In there, we have 2 main folder trees that need to make a flow.

There is a file named `.starter` to store the details of each extension. It will be created by the developers & will store in the repo that they commit their extensions.

If a developer wants to publish their `extension`, he/she needs to write a `.starter` file in their repo. You will know how to do that in the next sections. After that, the developer sends the `.starter` to us for the first time. We register the extension and users will have to download it. Developers won't submit it manually all the time. They need to update the `.starter` and commit to their repo.

In the `HotspotMaker` repo, there is a `GitHub` workflow to trigger the `Extensions.jar` once per day. It will read the `Extensions.db` database in the `HotspotMaker` repo and collect the `.starter` files from other repos. If there are changes in collected `.starter`s, `database` version updates with the new details.

When the `Hotspot Maker` application users trigger an update request of the `Extensions.db`, the database will download & fetch data to their local application. After that, if there a download request for an `extension`, the downloaded database will provide the details. If it's the first time, the `WinRAR.exe` (we can call it installer) from our repo and extension from developer repo will download. After that, there's a process to install the downloaded extension.

This is the basics of the extensions!
