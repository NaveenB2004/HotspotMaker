### Why do we need extensions?

The `Hotspot Maker` is basically a program to start and stop hosted networks on a `Windows` environment. In extensions, we aim to give the users a much better experience beyond making hotspots.

I mean, there's no in-built `file sharing` system in the `Windows` environment. I know it has. But, sometimes it's hard to config. So, as an example, you can make a `file sharing` system. Why do you need to embed with `Hotspot Maker`? You know, the hotspot is used to transmit data. So, it will be a great deal!
