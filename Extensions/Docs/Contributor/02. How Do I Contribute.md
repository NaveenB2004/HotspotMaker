### What are the basic needs?

1. Any environment that can use in `Windows`.\
   Like `Java Runtime`, `Python` etc.
2. Any language that can run on mentioned environment.\
   Like `Java`, `Kotlin`, `Python`, etc.
3. It need to relate to the `hotspot`.\
   Because it's for `Hotspot Maker`
4. Cloud space to store project.\
   `GitHub` (recomanded), `Google Drive`, etc.
5. A copy of [Extensions.jar](https://github.com/NaveenB2004/HotspotMaker/raw/main/Extensions/Application/Binary/Extensions.jar).\
   To create, update & read `.starter` (esiest way). To run it, you also need `Java Runtime` ([download from here!](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) - v17.x of `JDK`)

### Application setup

`Hotspot Maker` need to get the version of the application each time. So, you should make sure to add `return` of `version number` when the extension called with `-v` *command-line argument*.

> As example, I have an application `Tester.xyz`. I'm passing argument `Tester.xyz -v`. Then the appliction `return` a *command-line* log `0.1`. It's the version of the `Tester.xyz` extension.
