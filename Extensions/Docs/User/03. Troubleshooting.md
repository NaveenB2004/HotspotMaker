### No extensions showing in my extensions table

If you are a first-time extensions access, the extensions database should be downloaded. The case will be the `bad internet connection` or `disabled UAC`. By the way, the application should indicate it with `Something went wrong! Try again later!` message body.

If there's no message like this or any other error appears, please go to [Contact Me!](#contact-me) section and send an email or telegram message to me.

Try to trigger the `Check Database Updates` button. If the problem is still on, continue reading...

- Bad Internet Connection :\
This can happen if you have `no internet connection` or `firewall configuration`. If you have access to the internet, but can't update the database, it can be a problem with your `firewall configuration`.\
\
The `Hotspot Maker` use the `Java Runtime` to run the application. Maybe you didn't give permission to the application in `firewall` to access the `internet`. Please google `how to give permissions to applications to connect to the internet in firewall windows`, then you can know how to do that.\
\
The other thing is, some networks block the sites (like college networks using `Fortinet firewall` to block access to gaming sites and more). The thing is, if they block the connection to `GitHub (https://github.com)`, you can't update the database. You need to inform to network admin and get access.

- Disabled UAC :\
`Hotspot Maker` needs `enabled UAC` to perform the tasks. `UAC` means user account control (Run as administrator). So, the application cannot modify the `Hotspot Maker` configuration files. So, in that case, you can `enable UAC` using right-click on `launcher` and selecting `Run as administrator.

### Can't update the extensions database

Please read the point [No extensions showing in my extensions table](#no-extensions-showing-in-my-extensions-table). You will get the answer.

### Can't install extensions

Please read the point [No extensions showing in my extensions table](#no-extensions-showing-in-my-extensions-table). You will get the answer.

### Can't uninstall extensions

Sometimes, there is a busy with the extension files. Try again to uninstall.
1. Make sure the extension is `closed` if you have opened it. Try again to uninstall.
2. Make sure that you have `active UAC` (read the point [No extensions showing in my extensions table](#no-extensions-showing-in-my-extensions-table) for more info). Try again to uninstall.
3. Try by restarting the `Hotspot Maker`. Try again to uninstall.
4. Finally reastarting `PC`. Try again to uninstall.

### Can't open extensions

This can be a developer problem. Please [contact me!](#contact-me)

### In extension, can't perform tasks

In-extension operations are not my area. Because, all extensions are not be made by me! So, if you have any in-extension problem, you can contact the extension's developer. There's buttons to go to `Source` & `Web` of the extension. You can inform them using it. If you can't find a answer either way, please [contact me!](#contact-me)
