Hotspot Maker is a software you can use to basically start & stop hotspots in a Windows environment. There we release `Java-based` GUI applications to make a better experience for users. Our good old CLI application is also [here](https://github.com/NaveenB2004/HotspotMaker/releases/tag/v2.7) for experiments. Try this out! And make sure to send feedback!
